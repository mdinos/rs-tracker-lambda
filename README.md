# rs-tracker-lambda
Grab rs stats from API and store in S3 AWS lambda.

## usage

Firstly, set environment variables:
`$ username='<rs user name>'`

You'll have to add a line invoking the lambda locally:
```
lambda_handler('event','context')
```

Run the script:
```
python rs_tracker_lambda.py
```

## packaging to lambda format
`./package.sh` will generate a .zip object in `../`

can be used with some basic terraform:

```
resource "aws_lambda_function" "rs_tracker_lamda" {
    filename         = "rs_tracker_lambda.zip"
    function_name    = "rs_tracker_lambda"
    role             = "<<your role here folks>>"
    handler          = "rs_tracker_lambda.lambda_handler"
    source_code_hash = "${base64sha256("rs_tracker_lambda.zip")}"
    runtime          = "python3.6"
    timeout = "30"
  
    environment {
        variables = {
            bucket = "<<your s3 bucket>>"
        }
    }
}
```

In your S3 bucket, you will need a users.json file at the base level, like this:
```json
{ "users" : ['user_1', ..., 'user_n'] }
```

## requirements

Pips will be installed by package.sh when zipped, but to install dependencies for development, cd to directory and::
```
pip install pipreqs
pipreqs ./
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
